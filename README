Code is work in progress

arduino sketch is ok, once uploaded to arduino, write text on serial port, it will be displayed
on the display. escape followed by a number will do a control character :
    ^[0 : switch to/from binary mode (everything is "on" ; space or 0 is "off")
    ^[1 : push an on pixel
    ^[2 : push an off pixel
    ^[3 : clear the screen
    ^[4 : put the screen to all on
    ^[5 : write a sample text
    ^[6 : print the display buffer

N.B. in binary mode the display buffer is not used.

python upload bitmap code is still work in progress (need to work out the matrix transformation
so it is correctly displayed).
